# Fake Job Listing Detection with Machine Learning

This project tackles the growing problem of fraudulent job postings by employing machine learning techniques to identify them. It leverages the power of three well-established algorithms: Random Forest, Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machines (SVM).

<b>Features:</b>

- <b>Data Preprocessing:</b> Explore the provided dataset, handle missing values, and perform necessary feature engineering to prepare the data for machine learning models.

- <b>Model Exploration:</b> Train Random Forest, Naive Bayes, and SVM models, optimizing hyperparameters when applicable.

- <b>Performance Evaluation:</b> Evaluate the performance of each model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Compare and analyze the results to identify the most effective model for this task.

- <b>Deployment (Optional):</b> Consider deploying the best performing model as a web service or API to be used in real-world applications.

<b>Getting Started</b>

<b>Clone the Repository:</b>

```bash
git clone https://github.com/noobcoder2000/Fake-Job-Listing.git
```

Use code with caution.

<b>Install Dependencies:</b>

Install the required Python libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Use code with caution.

This command assumes you have a `requirements.txt` file that lists the necessary libraries.

<b>Run the Project:</b>

Execute the Jupyter Notebook or Python script (`main.py`) to train and evaluate the models.

<b>Data Description</b>

Provide a brief description of the dataset used for this project. This should include:

- <b>Source:</b> Where did you obtain the data? (e.g., Kaggle, public dataset, custom dataset)

- <b>Key Features:</b> What are the main features included in the dataset that are relevant to identifying fake job listings?

- <b>Considerations:</b> Are there any specific challenges or considerations related to this data that users of your project should be aware of? (e.g., data cleaning, missing values)

<b>Models</b>

<b>Random Forest</b>

A Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that combines the predictions of multiple decision trees. It strengthens performance by reducing variance and handling complex datasets effectively. Potential hyperparameters that could be tuned include the number of trees in the forest, maximum depth of each tree, and feature selection criteria.

<b>Naive Bayes</b>

Naive Bayes is a probabilistic classifier that makes strong assumptions about independence between features. It offers simplicity and efficiency, but these assumptions may not always hold true for real-world data.

<b>Support Vector Machines (SVM)</b>

SVMs find optimal hyperplanes to separate data points belonging to different classes. They have the ability to learn complex decision boundaries and offer various kernel types (e.g., linear, polynomial, RBF) to model non-linear relationships.

<b>Evaluation</b>

This section will present the performance of each model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Consider including tables or visualizations (e.g., confusion matrices) to compare the results and discuss which model performed best for this specific dataset.
